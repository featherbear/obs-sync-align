* GUI to pick video sources
  * Sources need to support audio/video filters, to use the async delay
  * Other sources (display capture) only have render delay (limited to 500ms); stack these?
  * Camera sources only?
* User selects sources they want to sync
* Frame capture
  * Have max capture time?
* Sync to the last source
* Affect the delays named SYNC_ALIGN_*
* Audio delay sync too (show waveform?)
* Web interface or OBS gui?
?
